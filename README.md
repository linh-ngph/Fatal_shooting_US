Overview
This project examines fatal police shootings in the United States from 2019 to 2023. The data combines sources from Census data and Mapping Police Violence to explore demographics, trends, and other insights related to police-involved fatalities. Through data analysis, statistical measures, SQL queries, and visualization in Tableau, the project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the patterns and factors surrounding these incidents.

Data Sources
US Census Data: Provides population demographics by state and race.
Mapping Police Violence: Contains detailed records of fatal police shootings, including victim demographics and location data.
Steps
Data Collection: Scraped and gathered data from US Census API and Mapping Police Violence.
Data Cleaning: Processed the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and data formatting issues.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated trends in fatal shootings over time, by state, and across demographic groups, using visualization and descriptive statistics.
Statistical Analysis: Applied statistical methods to understand correlations and patterns in the data.
SQL Queries: Organized data into a relational database and wrote SQL queries to extract insights and perform aggregations.
Tableau Visualizations: Created interactive dashboards to visualize the data and make the findings accessible.
Key Insights
Trends in the frequency and distribution of fatal police shootings.
Demographic disparities by race, gender, and age in relation to police-involved fatalities.
State-by-state comparisons to identify areas with higher rates of incidents.
Tools Used
Python: For data scraping, cleaning, and statistical analysis.
SQL: For organizing data and performing queries.
Tableau: For visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn: For EDA and statistical analysis.
